#Assignment 0
I have learned the basics of GitHub, including the organization (branches and forks), along with how to make a repository, a readme, and create pull requests. I am still learning my way around GitHub Classroom with this class, as this is my first time using a GitHub Classroom environment. I have finished the GitHub crash course video and the intro steps of this week.
